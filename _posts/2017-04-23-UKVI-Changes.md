From November 2015, the UK Visas and Immigration Department will only accept **Trinity GESE exams** or **IELTS SELT Consortium exams** for visas for entry to the UK or for applications for settlement or citizenship.

Spouses or partners of a British citizen (or settled person) who wish to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) - **if they arrived in the UK on or after 9 July 2012** - must now wait until theyâ€™ve lived in the UK for 5 years (not 2, as it used to be) before they can apply.  This means that when their initial 30-month visa expires, they must apply for Further Leave to Remain (FLR) for the next 30 months.

The Government now requires all FLR applicants to have passed a speaking and listening test at CEFR level A2.
