NATECLA, the professional organisation for ESOL teachers, has seen a revival in the last year of its North-West branch.  This is very welcome for us, based, as we are, on the cusp of both the Midlands and the North-West.  It means more opportunities to get together with other teachers to share ideas and to learn from one another. 

Last month we attended the national conference held at Nottingham University.  One of the keynote speakers was the highly entertaining Jamie Keddie whose ideas on the combined use of YouTube and story-telling in the classroom were inspirational.  As always, there was a great variety of workshops to attend and it was good see some familiar faces and catch up with colleagues from all over the country.
