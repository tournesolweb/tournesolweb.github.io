"I have been having lessons with Jenny twice a week for the past year. I am a 35 year old Gambian male. When I arrived in England 1 year ago I could speak quite good English but I could not read or write. With Jenny's kindness, and patience my life has changed completely for the better. I can read, and I can write and am improving every day.

I felt so nervous and embarrassed when I went for my first class because I could not read and write, but Jenny she made me feel completely comfortable from the very first lesson and my confidence now has grown so much. Learning to read and write has helped me to find a good job, and become much more independent, I can do so much more for myself.

Jenny she makes her lessons fun and interesting. Whilst we are working towards me taking the Trinity GESE 5 exam and preparing for the Life in the UK test, Jenny also teaches me things that are relevant in my life at the moment such as helping me with learning the highway code in preparation for the theory exam.

In one year I've come so far. Thank you so much Jenny, you're a wonderful teacher."
