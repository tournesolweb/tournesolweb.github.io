"I've been having lessons with Jenny twice a week for the past year. When I arrived in England I could speak quite good English but I could not read or write. With Jenny's kindness and patience my life has changed completely for the better. Now I can read and write and am improving every day. I felt so nervous and embarrassed when I went for my first class because I could not read and write, but Jenny she made me feel completely comfortable from the very first lesson and my confidence now has grown so much. Learning to read and write has helped me to find a good job, and become much more independent, I can do so much more for myself. Jenny she makes her lessons fun and interesting. Whilst we are working towards the tests I'll need to pass to stay in the UK, Jenny also teaches me things that are relevant in my life at the moment such as helping me prepare for my driving theory exam. In one year I've come so far. Thank you so much Jenny, you're a wonderful teacher."
