## ...unacceptable unsettling uncertainty

We at Tournesol School are dismayed at the referendum result which has set the UK on a road out of the European Union.  We believe it will be damaging to the people of this country.  And among the people of this country are many from other countries who have made the UK their home.  It is wrong and shameful that many of these are now being used as bargaining chips in the Brexit negotiations.  It is callous and inhumane to leave EU citizens in limbo, unsure of their future status here.  We believe that immigrants make a valuable contribution to our society and we abhor the increase in hate crimes and overt racism that has been manifest in the year following the lamentable 'leave' decision.
