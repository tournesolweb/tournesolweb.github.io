We travelled to the Netherlands in August 2014 for the 10th LESLLA conference.  We met teachers from all over Europe and from the US, united by their special interest in teaching English as a second language to immigrant students who also need to acquire literacy, having had little or no schooling in their country of origin.  Workshops and presentations were fascinating and varied, many with intriguing titles such as ‘Adventures in Storage Space’ and ‘Pull Out Grannies’!  We hope to go again to this excellent conference, perhaps not this year but next.
