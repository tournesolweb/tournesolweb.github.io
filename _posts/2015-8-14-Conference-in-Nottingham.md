In May, we attended a half-day conference in Nottingham, organised by the Midlands branch of the National Association for Teaching English and Community Languages to Adults (NATECLA).  It was well worth travelling from our Cheshire base for this event to hear such speakers as Judith Kirsh and Jo Gakonga, luminaries in the world of UK ESOL teaching. 

Judith ran a workshop entitled ‘Teaching basic literacy to ESOL learners – Where do I start?’.  She highlighted the ‘Language Experience Approach’, a method I would endorse, having tried it and been pleased with the results.  Literacy learners really benefit from this kind of one-to-one teaching.  Sadly though, with government cuts to ESOL provision in colleges, second language literacy learners, if they get a place on a course (and this is increasingly difficult), are often placed in an Entry One class where they’re likely to struggle alongside classmates who already read and write.

Jo Gakonga’s workshop introduced us to a wealth of internet resources for ESOL teaching and learning: not simply original material such as YouTube might provide but also a number of sites with extensive interactivity for the teacher and the student.  For example, eduCanon allows a teacher to add annotation and questions to video material.  The learner can then access this outside of the classroom and the teacher can see, online, how that student is doing and offer feedback.

Regrettably, we couldn’t make it to this year’s NATECLA national conference in June but we know these are great events from which much can be learned so we’re hoping to be back again in 2016.
