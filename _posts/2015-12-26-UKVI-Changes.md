From November 2015, the UK Visas and Immigration Department will only accept **Trinity GESE exams** or **IELTS SELT Consortium exams** for visas for entry to the UK or for applications for settlement or citizenship.

Spouses or partners of a British citizen (or settled person) who wish to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) - **if they arrived in the UK on or after 9 July 2012** - must now wait until they’ve lived in the UK for 5 years (not 2, as it used to be) before they can apply.  This means that when their initial 30-month visa expires, they must apply for Further Leave to Remain (FLR) for the next 30 months.

However, if their English language test at level A1 was accepted for their first visa application, this will still be valid: they won’t have to take another A1 exam for FLR, even if the exam they took was not on the current list of approved Secure English Language Tests (SELTs).
