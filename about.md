I love language and love teaching.  I’ve taught English at all levels, but have a special interest in teaching literacy.  I keep my skills up-to-date via NATECLA (the association for ESOL teachers) and by attending conferences in the UK and overseas. Because I’ve spent a lot of time teaching in Asian communities, I know that some learners prefer to have an all-female class such as we at Tournesol can provide.

As well as teaching English, I’ve worked in government, universities and with many local communities for over 30 years.  I’ve a real passion for helping people make sense of what it’s like to live and work in England.  I’m a NATECLA member and take part in ESOL conferences in the UK and abroad.  Whether you choose one-to-one or group teaching, I’ll use my wide knowledge and experience to make sure that your course meets your needs.
